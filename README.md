a boilerplate for a node jwt authentification

Here are some web servers with basic json web token authenification for a REST architecture with node.js
Still experimenting with implementation and will release more when boilerplate get bulletproof. 

ex1 - first attempt, code organization very simple
ex2 - still very similiar to ex1, but better organized.  plan to add more elaborate features for user based rest server.
